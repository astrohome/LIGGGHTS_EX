This package implements the concentration-dependent EAM (CD-EAM)
potential for multi-component systems.

Specifically, the pair style implements an improved version of the
original CD-EAM formalism.  The new version (a.k.a. one-site model;
cdeamVersion==1) has been published in

   Efficient implementation of the concentration-dependent embedded
   atom method for molecular-dynamics and Monte-Carlo simulations
   Model. Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng., 2009, 075005

This new formulation is more efficient for MD and Monte-Carlo
simulations and is the default.
 
The original formulation (a.k.a. two-site model; cdeamVersion==2) is
also implemented and has been published in
