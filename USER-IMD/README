The files in this directory are a user-contributed package for LAMMPS.

The person who created these files is Axel Kohlmeyer
(axel.kohlmeyer@temple.edu).  Contact him directly if you 
have questions or for example scripts that use it.

This package implements a "fix imd" command which can be used in a
LAMMPS input script.  IMD stands for interactive molecular dynamics,
and allows realtime visualization and manipulation of MD simulations
through the IMD protocol, initially implemented in VMD and NAMD.

There are example scripts for using this package with LAMMPS in
examples/USER/imd.

This software includes code developed by the Theoretical and Computational 
Biophysics Group in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and 
Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
