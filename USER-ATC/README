This package implements a "fix atc" command which can be used in a
LAMMPS input script.  This fix can be employed to either do concurrent
coupling of MD with FE-based physics surrogates or on-the-fly
post-processing of atomic information to continuum fields.  See the
doc page for the fix atc command to get started.

There are example scripts for using this package with LAMMPS in
examples/USER/atc.
